# Agile methodology:
 
## What does agile methodology mean? 
The real utility of agile methods is to provide people with a common basis for making decisions about the best way to develop software. It has four principles:

Individuals and people over tools and processes
Advancing software over documentation
With the customer, collaboration is valued over negotiation.
Being open to change is preferable to following a fixed plan.

## Why? 
It emerges from the obsolescence of the cascade model which is a process of sequential development, in which the software development is conceived as a set of stages that are executed one after the other. This system does not anticipate the sudden changes that both customers and technologies tend to have

## Agile Estimation:
The agile estimate is just that: a team-wide estimate of how long the project will take.
## Story Points:
Story points are units of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.
## Absolute & Relative Estimation:
These are ways of expressing an estimation.
Absolute Estimation focuses on the ideal time and is expressed in hours.
Relative Estimation focuses on size and complexity and is expressed in story points.

# Scrum:



## What is it? 
Scrum is a framework which starts from the premise that no project is going to be static and linear (see agile methodologies). 

## Why? 

Scrum is about humanizing the process so that a team can optimize its pursuit of a goal. Using scrum makes taking faster and specific decisions. Scrum is more structured. Therefore, it is better than other methodologies if the project is complex.
How does it works? 

## Sprints :
The project is "shredded" into small parts which have S.M.A.R.T. objectives, these are called SPRINTS. These can last up to 1 month but usually have an average of  2 weeks.

## Planning Meeting : 
At the beginning of each Sprint, the planning meeting is held to define the objectives for the next Sprint.


## Daily Sprints/ Daily Stand Up / DSU:

Is a short daily meeting (15min)  which is held to know, What did you do yesterday?
What will you do today? & if it is Anything blocking your progress?


## Sprint Review Meeting:

At the end of the Sprint, a "Review" is carried out to consider how the tasks were performed and which ones could not be performed, and why a "Demo" is usually carried out.

## Sprint Retrospective:
The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.


## Scrum Team:

### Scrum Master: 
The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Teamâ€™s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.

### Product Owner:
It is the customer side or the voice of the customers, a good product owner must be able to describe the "features" that a product must have

### Developers:
Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
 
## Scrum Artifacts:
Scrum artifacts are tools used to represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. 

### Product Backlog:
The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
### Sprint Backlog:
This is a list of items to work on during the Sprint stage.
### Increment:
 An Increment is the result of the Sprint.
